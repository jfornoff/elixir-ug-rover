# Rover

This is the scaffolding repository for the Rover Kata implemented at the Elixir UG
Cologne on 5th June 2018.

## Testing

To run all unskipped tests, execute:
```shell
mix test
```

You can now iteratively un-skip tests by removing
```elixir
@tag :skip
```
above the test.

**Happy coding!**
